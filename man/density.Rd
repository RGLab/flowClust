\usage{
\S4method{density}{flowClust}(x, data = NULL, subset = c(1, 2),
  include = 1:(x@K), npoints = c(100, 100), from = NULL, to = NULL)

\S4method{density}{flowClustList}(x, data = NULL, subset = c(1, 2),
  include = 1:(x@K), npoints = c(100, 100), from = NULL, to = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object returned from \code{\link{flowClust}} or from running
\code{filter} on a \code{flowFrame} object.}

\item{data}{A matrix, data frame of observations, or object of class
\code{flowFrame}.  This is the object on which \code{flowClust} or
\code{filter} was performed.  If this argument is not specified, the grid
square upon which densities will be computed must be provided (through
arguments \code{from} and \code{to}).}

\item{subset}{A numeric vector of length two indicating which two variables
are selected for the scatterplot.  Alternatively, a character vector
containing the names of the two variables is allowed if \code{x@varNames} is
not \code{NULL}.}

\item{include}{A numeric vector specifying which clusters are included to
compute the density values.  By default, all clusters are included.}

\item{npoints}{A numeric vector of size two specifying the number of grid
points in \eqn{x} (horizontal) and \eqn{y} (vertical) directions
respectively.}

\item{from}{A numeric vector of size two specifying the coordinates of the
lower left point of the grid square.  Note that, if this (and \code{to}) is
not specified, \code{data} must be provided such that the range in the two
variables (dimensions) selected will be used to define the grid square.}

\item{to}{A numeric vector of size two specifying the co-ordinates of the
upper right point of the grid square.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{flowDens} containing the following slots is
constructed: \item{dx}{A numeric vector of length \code{npoints[1]}; the
\eqn{x}-coordinates of the grid points.} \item{dy}{A numeric vector of
length \code{npoints[2]}; the \eqn{y}-coordinates of the grid points.}
\item{value}{A matrix of size \code{npoints[1]} \eqn{\times}{x}
\code{npoints[2]}; the density values at the grid points.}
}
\description{
This method constructs the \code{flowDens} object which is used to generate
a contour or image plot.
}
\details{
The \code{flowDens} object returned is to be passed to the \code{plot}
method for generating a contour or image plot.
