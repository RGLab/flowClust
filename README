You need GSL for the flowClust package. So you should make sure it is installed on your machine if you want to use flowClust. 
GSL is free and can be downloaded here http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ for 'nix distributions and here http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm for windows. 

Windows users: In order for the flowClust package to properly work on windows you need to tell flowClust where your GSL library and header files are. You can do that by setting up two variables GSL_INC and GSL_LIB with the correct path to the header files and library files. You may wish to include two lines in your .bashrc files so that you do not have to do that every time. In your .bashrc file, include the following two lines:
export $GSL_LIB='-L/path/to/your/gsl/lib/directory'
export $GSL_INC='-I/path/to/your/gsl/include/directory'

Unix/Linux/Mac users: The package will look for a BLAS library on your system, and by default it will 
use gslcblas, which is not optimized for your system. To 
use an optimized BLAS library, you can use the --with-blas argument which 
will be passed to the configure.ac file. For example, on a Mac with vecLib 
pre-installed the package may be installed via: 
R CMD INSTALL flowClust_x.y.z.tar.gz --configure-args="--with-blas='-framework vecLib'"
